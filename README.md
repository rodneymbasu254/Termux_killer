One tool for killing unwanted jobs in termux

# Overview
Termux is a linux-based command line interface for Android devices. Has built-in commands similar to the real linux operating system.

# scope
For any linux system  processes running or simply jobs are essential and some needs to be stoped or reniced*

# Usage
In your termux working environment type killer then hit enter. You will be prompted to enter your name. Then you will be prompted to enter the PID (PROCESS_ID). For beginners, every Linux job is given a unique ID number. The reason why the jobs are given IDs is because since you are interacting with the shell you may want to prioritize certain jobs. Also if you feel like a certain job is wasting your memory you may want to stop it from running. Cool stuff huh!! In this program the PIDs are displayed together with their corresponding jobs so there is no need for guess work.
